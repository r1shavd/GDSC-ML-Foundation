## About Me

Hi, I'm Rishav, a passionate learner and aspiring machine learning enthusiast. I started my journey into machine learning to gain knowledge of latest technologies and help in contributing towards their development. Follow along as I navigate through various concepts, challenges, and projects in the dynamic world of ML.

## Learning Path

- **Introduction to Machine Learning:**
  - Completed online courses (e.g., youtube channels) on machine learning fundamentals.
  - Explored key concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

- **Programming Languages:**
  - Gained proficiency in Python, including popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - Currently practising machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
  - Learning how to implement models using scikit-learn for hands-on experience.

## Resources
